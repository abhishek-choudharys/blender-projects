A showcase for some of my blender projects.

What is Blender?

Blender is a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality and computer games. Blender's features include 3D modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, raster graphics editing, rigging and skinning, fluid and smoke simulation, particle simulation, soft body simulation, sculpting, animating, match moving, rendering, motion graphics, video editing, and compositing. 

Note : You do not need to know any coding if you want to go the basic 3d modeling route, however, advanced 3d modelling requires you to write code.

Shown below are some graphics made using Blender 2.8 and above.
